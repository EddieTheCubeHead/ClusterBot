# Clusterbot

The official bot of the unofficial discord server for the LUT-University Software Engineering guild Cluster.

## Main features (WIP)

The bot is currently planned to be used on the server for three main purposes:

1. Authorizing members
2. Allowing self-allocation of game-based roles
3. Arranging official ballots

The features should be described in further detail in corresponding issues in the
[bot's issue tracker](https://github.com/EddieTheCubeHead/ClusterBot/issues)
